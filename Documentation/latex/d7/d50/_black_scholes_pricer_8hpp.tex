\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declaration and comprehensive documentation of the \doxylink{class_black_scholes_pricer}{Black\+Scholes\+Pricer} class. 

This header file declares the \doxylink{class_black_scholes_pricer}{Black\+Scholes\+Pricer} class, which implements the analytical pricing model for European options using the Black-\/\+Scholes formula. The class provides methods for computing both the option price and its sensitivity measures (\doxylink{struct_greeks}{Greeks}) such as Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho.

The Black-\/\+Scholes formula is a widely recognized model in quantitative finance, relying on the assumption of a log-\/normal distribution of the underlying asset\textquotesingle{}s returns with constant volatility and interest rates. It is applicable exclusively to European style options.

The class integrates with a \doxylink{struct_pricing_configuration}{Pricing\+Configuration} object to allow for flexible specification of market parameters, including but not limited to the risk-\/free interest rate, the option maturity, and the calculation date. This facilitates easy adaptation to different market scenarios and risk management strategies.
